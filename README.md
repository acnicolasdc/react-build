# Â¿React Build?

React build is a project that seeks to build a concept of building components, worrying about scalability, maintainability and above all the ease of development.

Each folder or element that you find within this project will have a **README** file that will describe under the criteria of *"What"*, *"Why"* and *"What for"* the functionalities and the need that it supplies.

Take the time to read each one so that you can understand the reason for everything in this project.
